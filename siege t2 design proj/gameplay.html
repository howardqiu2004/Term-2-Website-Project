				<i>Rainbow Six Siege</i> is a first person shooter where players utilize different operators from the Rainbow team. Each operator has their different weapons and gadgets. The game allows for the players to make the teams uneven with specific operator abilities. There are currently 54 playable operators for players to choose from, each from one of the 24 CTUs (Counter-Terrorism Units). Players also have access to a "Recruit" operator, who has more flexibility in gadgets, but that comes at the cost of having a special ability and the customization of weapon attachments. Players pick the operator they want to play before the game starts, they choose their spawn location and are able to change the attachments on their weapons but won't be able to change anything when the match starts, except for attackers who are able to change their spawn location during their drone phase. Players recieve an in-game currency called "Renown" which is earned after each match. This currency is used to buy new operators or to unlock certain cosmetics. Different gameplay modes grants renown at different rates with ranked matches giving the highest renown potential per match. Players can also complete in-game challenges to get a small amount of renown. Renown gain can be changed with boosters, which gives the player a 2x bonus on their renown gain for a set period of time. There is also a premium currency known as R6 Credits, which is purchased with real-world currency. It is able to be traded in for Renown to buy operators, or it can be used to buy cosmetics and boosters.

				When a round begins in an online match, attackers choose a spawn location from the several that are listed to start off their attack while 	defenders do the same, but for their defending location. A one minute "drone phase" is initiated to allow for the attackers to try to locate the objective, opposing operators and traps using mecanum-wheeled drones while the opposing team tries to prevent the detection of the objective by shooting the drones. The maps are specifically designed for close quarters combat and players are unable to respawn until the next round starts. Once a player dies, they enter "Support Mode", where they can view the avaliable cameras for their team. They are able to provide information to the team such as the location of the enemies and what they're doing. Matches last 4 minutes in a casual match and 3 minutes in a ranked match due to the fact that ranked matches can have up to a maximum of 9 rounds and casual matches have a maximum of 5. Teamwork, cooperation and communication between players is heavily encouraged as players with specific abilities may need other players to assist them in using it, an example would be getting Thatcher, who has EMP grenades, to destroy any of Bandit's Shock wires or Kaid's Electroclaws which electricutes walls to allow for Thermite or Hibana to destroy reinforced walls.

				The game puts a heavy emphasis on the environmental destruction allowed in the game. Players are able to break most structures by using explosives or shooting them. The destruction may provide certain advantages to encourage players to utilize their creativity and strategy. There's also a bullet-penetration system, which reduces the damage of bullets that pass through structures. Players are able to put up a limited number of reinforcements on walls and hatches to provide for extra protection, as these cannot be destroyed with any ordinary explosive or gun.
